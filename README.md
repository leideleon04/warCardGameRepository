"# warCardGameRepository" 


Hello there, 


This is a simple card game that reads through the default browser's console. 
Each game and round is randomized, as it mimics the card game War. At of a round, the console will announce a winner.
At the end of the game, the console will anounce a winner after tallying the points earned. 


Have fun checking out my code,


Lei de Leon.
